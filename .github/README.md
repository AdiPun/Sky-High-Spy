## Hello!

Welcome to Sky High Spy, an Asteroids-style game I developed using [SumoDigital's Playbuffer](https://github.com/sumo-digital-academy/playbuffer), a single-header C++ library for making simple 2D games.

### The game and using Playbuffer

This game was incredibly fun to make. Using Sumodigital's header and tutorial taught me various essential concepts in game development using C++. Throughout the development process, I learned how to:

- Code in C++
- Create functions and use enumeration, state machines, arrays and vectors
- Assign types, velocities, and acceleration to game objects
- Implement collision detection using axis-aligned bounding boxes
- Code logically and efficiently

### Gameplay

Sky High Spy is an Asteroids-style game where you use arrow keys to steer Agent-8, our spy spider, as they jump from asteroid to asteroid using SPACEBAR. Avoid the meteors and collect enough gems to progress to the next level!

### Sky High Spy
"bzzt Space log Agent-8, 960 hrs since deployment. I will continue to survive though I believe the humans have abandoned me and the project. Don't feel sorry for me, after all, we're all just tiny robot spiders floating through space, collecting gems uncovered from asteroids while dodging meteors?" - Agent-8.
"At least I get a pink hat... and lasers" - Agent-8.
